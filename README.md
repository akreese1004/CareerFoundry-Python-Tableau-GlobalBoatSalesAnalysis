# Python and Tableau

# Global Boat Sales Analysis

**Project Summary:**

Performed an advanced analysis of open sourced data pertaining to global boat sales and built a presentation for company stakeholders.  

* Sourced open data in regards to global boat sales and cleaned, analyzed, and explored potential variable relationships within the dataset.
* Utilized python to run geospatial, regression, clustering, and time series forecasting models
* Compiled insights and data visualization in Tableau story for stakeholder review.

# Project Brief from CareerFoundry

### **Objective** 

To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

### **Data Requirements**

The data set(s) you choose must:

* Be open-source.
* Come from an authentic/authoritative source.
* Include non-anonymized column names.
* Be recent (ideally, no more than 3 years old).
* Contain at least 2-3 continuous variables (apart from index variables, ID variables, dates, years, etc).
* Contain at least 2-3 categorical variables (apart from index variables, ID variables, dates, years etc).
* Contain at least 1,500 rows.
* Include a geographical object of some kind: for instance, a column relating to a country, continent, or something similar. If the information from the data set refers to the US, for example, there should be a column containing the names/abbreviations of the states.
* In the course of the Achievement you will source a time series data set too, but this procedure will be explained explicitly in the corresponding Exercise, so you donâ€™t need to worry about it now.

### **Analysis Criteria**

* Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots and categorical plots)
* Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
* Regression analysis
* Cluster analysis
* Time-series analysis
* Analysis narrative and final results (presented in a dashboard)
